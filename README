What it is:

	Module Net::Dnet (incomplete, pre-alpha), an future add-on
	to the Net-ext bundle from me.  Only for systems with DECnet
	phase IV or phase V support.  It's only here because it escaped
	as part of `net-ext-a8' (which was a work-in-progress drop).
	This separate distribution is just to finish superseding the
	entries in the module list for CPAN.pm so that the older files can
	be deleted.



Anyway, bug reports & feature requests to me (spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US).
